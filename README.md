Summary: This is an application that can classify whether a given chest X-Ray image is Nomal or has Pneumonia. The app is powered by a custom trained multi-class classification model in Amazon Sagemaker using a dataset from Kaggle. The repo contains the Sagemaker notebook used to train the model and front-end code to expose the model endpoint to make predictions.
